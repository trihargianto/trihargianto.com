## Preface

> This article is a living document, meaning that when I use something new or need to add something, I will update this article as well.

> Last updated: December 24, 2023

When this article was first written, I didn't know how to quickly set up the applications, configurations, and tools I often use on my MacBook for development. Several times I struggled when I had to use a fresh MacBook according to my needs. Whether it's provided by the office, after being reset, or a new MacBook.

I even once needed a whole day to configure everything I needed, so I couldn't be productive right away. Every time I felt everything was complete, when working, it turned out there was something missing, and eventually, my work was disrupted because I had to continue setting up again to work comfortably.

I created this article as a note to make it easier when I have to set up again later. Since I am a Web Developer, most of the applications and configurations I do here will be around JavaScript / NodeJS. So, if you have the same profession as me, I hope this article can be your note too.

## Homebrew

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as a package manager on Mac. The installation method for Homebrew is quite clear on its website.

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

## Desktop Applications

The applications I use are divided into two types: automatic installation via Homebrew and manual installation.

### Automatic Installation

After Homebrew is installed, I can continue to install all the applications I need via Homebrew automatically:

```shell
brew install --cask docker google-chrome iterm2 imageoptim kap notion openvpn-connect postman raycast slack spotify sequel-pro visual-studio-code whatsapp
```

The command above will install the applications I need, namely:

| Program                                                  | Function                |

| [Whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/download)            | Whatsapp Desktop        |

### Manual Installation

Because not all applications are available in Homebrew Cask by default, they have to be installed manually.

| Program                                                                                     | Function                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| [Codewhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/)                                      | Terminal auto-completion                           |
| [Focus To-Do](https://www.focustodo.cn/)                                                    | Pomodoro & Todo App                                |

| [ObinsKit](https://www.hexcore.xyz/obinskit/releases)                                       | [Anne Pro 2](https://getannepro.com/) Keyboard App |
| [XAMPP 7.3.33.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Mac%20OS%20X/7.3.33/) | PHP 7.3 + MySQL Runner                             |

## Shell

I use [Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) as the main shell. Fortunately, [MacOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/id/macos/sonoma/) already includes Zsh as the default shell. So, just install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to get all the plugins I need right away.

### Install Ohmyzsh

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### Ohmyzsh Plugins

The plugins I often use in ZSH are as follows:

#### Built-in Plugin

Plugins that are automatically available when installing Ohmyzsh so just activate them

| Plugin                                                                                          | Function                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [Alias Finder](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/alias-finder)             | To find aliases in Shell                    |
| [Autojump](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/autojump)                     | Jump directories in Shell quickly           |
| [Copydir](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/copydir)                       | Copy the active directory path to clipboard |
| [Git](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git)                               | Git command shortcuts                       |
| [Yarn](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/yarn)                             | Yarn command shortcuts                      |
| [ZSH Interactive CD](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/zsh-interactive-cd) | Easier directory navigation                 |
| [ZSH Reload](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/zsh_reload)                 | Quick way to reload ZSH configuration       |

#### External Plugin

Ohmyzsh plugins that must be downloaded manually:

| Plugin                                                                  | Function                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [ZSH Autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) | Autocomplete based on history |
| [ZSH Vim Mode](https://github.com/softmoth/zsh-vim-mode)                | Vim-like Shell                |

After ensuring the Built-in and External Plugins above are installed, we just need to activate the plugins in the **~/.zshrc** file:

```txt{3,5-16}:title=~/.zshrc
...

alias af="alias-finder -l"

plugins=(
 git
 yarn
 alias-finder
 autojump
 npm
 zsh_reload
 copydir
 zsh-interactive-cd
 zsh-autosuggestions
 zsh-vim-mode
)

...
```

Don't forget to reload the **~/.zshrc** configuration file:

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

> I have discussed the plugins above in the article [More Productive Coding with Terminal Plugins](/blog/koding-lebih-produktif-dengan-plugin-terminal/)

## Node.js

I choose to install Node.js via Node Version Manager (NVM) so I can easily switch versions, as I often need to switch to older or newer Node versions. Besides that, for the package manager, I still prefer using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) over NPM because it's faster.

### Install NVM & Node.js

Install NVM

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.36.0/install.sh | bash
```

Install Latest Node

```shell
nvm install node
```

Switch Node Version

```shell
nvm install xx.xx && nvm use xx.xx
```

Then set the newly installed one as the default

```shell
nvm alias default xx.xx
```

### Install Yarn via Homebrew

```shell
brew install yarn
```

## Git

Installation and Configuration of Git

### Install

Install Git via Homebrew:

```shell
brew install git
```

After Git is installed, make sure to set up the profile in the global configuration

```shell
git config --global user.name "Full Name" && git config --global user.email "emailaddress@mail.com"
```

### Git Syntax Highlighter

I also like to use [Delta](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/) for syntax highlighting in Git to make it more comfortable when doing `git diff` or `git show`.

Install Delta:

```shell
brew install git-delta
```

Then edit the **~/.gitconfig** file. Usually, I configure it like this.

```txt:title=~/.gitconfig
[core]
    pager = delta

[interactive]
    diffFilter = delta --color-only

[delta]
    navigate = true

[merge]
    conflictstyle = diff3

[diff]
    colorMoved = default
```

[Click here](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/configuration.html) to see what configurations are available.

## System Settings

_This section I use MacOS Sonoma and depends on personal preference..._

### Desktop & Dock

- Set "Default web browser" to Google Chrome
- Disable "Show suggested and recent apps in Dock" to keep the Dock consistent
- Adjust Dock size to be smaller because the default size is too big for me

### Accessibility

- Open "Pointer Control" > "Trackpad Options", and set "Dragging Style" to "Three Finger Drag" to drag-and-drop using three fingers.

### Trackpad

- Check "Tap to click" so you don't always have to press the Trackpad to click

### Keyboard

Even though the language I use on the Mac is English, I have to make sure the following settings are off so that every time I write an Indonesian word, the Mac doesn't try to change it to a word it thinks is correct.

In the "Input Sources" section, click "Edit" then set the following options:

- Disable "Show Input menu in menu bar"
- Disable "Correct spelling automatically"
- Disable "Capitalize words automatically"
- Disable "Show inline predictive text"
- Disable "Add period with double-space"
- Disable "Use smart quotes and dashes"

## Misc

Other settings

### Quick access to screenshots

1. Create a folder named "Screenshots" on the Desktop
2. Press `Cmd` + `Shift` + `5`. Then click "Options" > "Other Location"
3. Select the folder created in step 1
4. Press `Esc` to exit the screenshot setting
5. Open Finder, find the "Screenshots" folder on the Desktop, then drag the folder to the Dock
6. With the folder now in the Dock, right-click on the folder and check "Fan" in the "view content as" section & check "Name" in the "sort by" section

import AccessingScreenshotsFasterWebm from "images/accessing-screenshots-faster.webm";
import AccessingScreenshotsFasterMp4 from "images/accessing-screenshots-faster.mp4";
