## Background

"[Vim](https://www.vim.org/)", one of the most challenging text editor for me.
I've remembered when I tried Vim for the first time, its feels so terrible. At
least for me who wrote code for the first using
[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).

Coding is all about thinking and logic. Writing code sometimes can be
frustrating. If we need to think harder about how to use a text editor, it's so
silly.

This is how its feels like to use Vim for the first time:

- If we want to use Vim, open the Terminal first, then we need to type `vim` or
  `vim file-name.js`
- When Vim gets opened, there's only a black screen. There's no buttons like
  "New file", "Save", "Undo", "Redo", etc.
- In this damn black screen, I thought I can start writing something, but I
  still can't. There's nothing happened when I pressing buttons on my keyboard.
  Not, until I press the `i` key first.
- After wrote some text, I start to confuse again. I just remembered that
  there's no "Save" button nor "Exit" button. After _gooling_ for a while, I
  found out that I need to press Esc first, then type `:wq`.
- That's all we need to do to even just putting a single word to the file. That
  was a bad experience for me, I don't want to use it again for years. I need a
  text editor to support my productivity, not the other way around.

Years after that, I always see someone use Vim in the Internet or in the
[JogjaJS Community](https://jogja.js.org/) offline event. I also found that Vim
ecosystem in the [Github](https://github.com/search?q=vim&type=repositories) is
very active.

This made me thinking:

> It's make no sense people keep using Vim if it's very hard to use and
> decreasing productivity.

With that in mind, I made my commitment to always use Vim when there's no
deadline on my work or on my spare time, like when working on my
[Pet Projects](/pet-projects) for instance. The reasons are:

- Give Vim its second chance, to prove whether it really make us productive or
  the other way around.
- Want to use another text editor other than
  [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- The last thing is just because I want to look cool.

## Phase 1: Learn the Basic Commands

In this first phase, I tried to find out how exactly to use Vim. I learnt about
Vim basic commands via [openvim.com](https://www.openvim.com/). I really
recommend this site for all of you who want to learn on how to use Vim.

Even though I don't remember all the things, at least now I know how to insert
text, save file, and know a bit about what Command Mode, Visual Mode, and Insert
Mode actually is.

## Phase 2: Use VSCodeVim

After knowing how to use Vim a bit, I don't use the real Vim in the Terminal,
but I use
[VSCodeVim Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)
instead. I've been using it for 6 months and I think this plugin is perfect for
someone like me who use VScode in the daily basis but also want the Vim
experience on it.

## Phase 3: Use zsh-vi-mode on my Terminal

I found out that this plugin is also useful on my Terminal.

With [zsh-vi-mode](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode), we can have Vim
experience when I need to put some commands on our Terminal. Let's say we have a
really long command, navigating the text command using Vim shortcut is really
easy with this plugin:

import ZshViModeWebm from "images/zsh-vi-mode.webm";
import ZshViModeMp4 from "images/zsh-vi-mode.mp4";

<Video webm={ZshViModeWebm} mp4={ZshViModeMp4} />

I really recommend this to be installed on your Terminal üëç

## Phase 4: Use NvChad

[NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) is one of the most popular Vim Distribution in the
Internet. "Distribution" means Vim with full package. There's several Vim
built-in plugins installed, so we can expect it'll has similar features compared
to other popular text editors like VSCode.

There are some other popular Vim Distribution, like
[LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) and [AstroVim](https://astronvim.com/).

The reason why I choose NvChad is simply because when this article was written,
NvChad has more Github stars than the others. I don't know anything about Vim
plugins, I hope NvChad is good for me üòÖ

You might be thinking, why do I use NvChad if I can just use VSCodeVim? It's
because I want to know how's the real Vim experience on the Terminal because
VSCodeVim is just an Vim emulator that runs on top of VSCode.

After I dedicating my self using NvChad, I felt my brain hurt. There's a lot of
things that unfamiliar to me and I need a dedicated time to learn about
configuring it so it'll match with my prefernce.

## Pros & Cons

Currently, I'm on Phase 4 for the next few months. If everythings goes well,
maybe in the next phase I want to install fresh Vim and configuring it from
scratch instead of using popular Vim Distribution.

There's some keypoints from what I learnt using Vim so far:

### Pros üòé

- Vim can fasten our typing experience only if we already know the shortcuts
- It can minimalize the Mouse usage because our hands will always close to the
  keyboard.
- I think it's perfect for someone who really like to fiddling their tools
  because we can configuring the text editors experience with our own
  preference.

### Cons ‚òπÔ∏è

- **It's not for everyone**. It has high learning curve, we need to allocating a
  dedicated time to learn on how to use it properly.
- It really can be a _boomerang_ for productivity, it also can becomes a big
  blocker for our work if we're not used to it.
- Installing plugins sometimes really complicated compared to what VSCode and
  other GUI text editors have.

## My Conclusion

From the Pros & Cons above, I think Vim can be the good productivity tools for
us only if we know how to use it. In fact, now I fall in love with the keyboard
mechanism and its shortcut üòÜ.

I also don't recommend you to learn on how to use Vim in your worktime or when
you're on a deadline because you'll regret it.
