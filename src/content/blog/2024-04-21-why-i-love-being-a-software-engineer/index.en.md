## How I Become a Software Engineer

It has been more than 10 years since I started my career in software development. Being a software engineer is one of the things I am most grateful for in my life.

Back then, in the hometown where I lived, becoming a mechanic is somehow really popular. They said after graduating, it’ll be easier to get jobs compared to other fields. From that understanding, it’s easy for me to sign up for the mechanical school because simply I want to get my first job right after I graduate.

I got rejected from mechanical school because I’m color-blind. That was also the first time I realized that I’m a red-green color-blind person. They said, It’s impossible to a person like me to work in the mechanical industry, or I’d ended up make machines exploded because working with the wrong colored wires.

Not long after that, I got accepted by a computer science school and they taught me to write web applications using PHP. After I graduated, I got my first job as a web developer. The more I work in this industry, the more I feel gratitude that God knows what is best for me. Alhamdulilah.

This article is a summary about why I felt so grateful for working as a Software Engineer.

## Accelerate the life impact through technology

Life is short and I want my life to have meaning. I want to be in an environment or company where I can put my efforts into giving value to others. Technology is the one I can think of that can accelerate the impact and values I deliver.

Throughout my career, the code I wrote has helped companies to generate revenue and also users to solve their problems. It feels so good knowing that what I did has real impact to others.

## A lot of soft skills learned

Most people see a programmer’s job is just about writing code. There’s a lot of things that people don’t always mention about this role. Personally, I learned a lot of soft skills and actually most of them are not specific for programmers only. Having the chance to hone these skills are luxurious since it’s applicable to other fields as well. Some of the examples are:

- Designing and building solutions that solve real problems.
- Able to communicate and negotiate well with people across divisions and roles.
- Think critically and formulate well-reasoned arguments
- Mentoring and helping other engineers
- Leading people to work on some projects
- Time management
- Write well-written documentation
- etc

## Learn new things

If there’s one quote that I liked the most, then it is from Steve Jobs: “Stay hungry, stay foolish”. For me, learning new things is the one that makes me feel life is more interesting. Software engineers are required to learn continuously since the technology is always evolving.

### Working with smart people

I also had the chance to work with smart people. Being surrounded and working with smart people are luxurious because they give me positive vibes and I can learn a lot from them.

### Knowledge Sharing

Sharing is also part of the learning process. I had several presentational talks, mentoring sessions, and being a programming instructor on my journey and it’s just so amazing. I’m such an introverted person but have this kind of chance. Just wow.

## The Freedom of Remote Work

Since most of the time software engineers worked in front of the screen. I had the chance to work from home. Having the ability to work from home is a privilege for someone like me since I can spend more time with my wife and family.

## Networking and Community Engagement

Despite my introverted nature, immersing myself in programming communities has been transformative. Through forums, meetups, and conferences, I've forged invaluable connections with like-minded individuals. These interactions go beyond professional networking, fostering genuine friendships and support networks. Engaging in community initiatives has not only expanded my skill set but also provided opportunities for my personal growth.

## Earned more money

At the time this article was written, Software engineering is one of the high-paid jobs in my country and I earned a lot from this job to buy stuff I like and help my family to solve our financial problems. I also able to make more money from things other than coding, for example being a programming instructor or a consultant.

## Conclusion

Thank God for this amazing journey. Alhamdulilah.
