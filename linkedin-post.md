## Post 1: Vibe Coding vs AI-Assisted Coding

Coding no longer means typing line by line. With AI, we describe WHAT we want, not HOW to do it.

But here's the catch: Vibe Coding is great for exploration and prototyping. For production code? You need AI-Assisted Coding with discipline and structure.

The goal isn't to write less code—it's to understand what your code does. Balance creativity with control.

## Post 2: Remote Team Building That Actually Works

Remote team building can feel forced. But the best teams aren't built in formal meetings.

They're built in moments of shared laughter, friendly competition, and chaos—like trying to draw a giraffe in 30 seconds.

I've tried many games with my team. The key? Keep sessions 15-30 minutes, make them optional, and rotate games to keep things fresh.

## Post 3: The Future of Frontend Development

What if UI design for web apps becomes obsolete?

Imagine a world where users no longer navigate through complex UI elements. They simply talk to AI.

Want shoes from a marketplace? Just ask AI. No clicking, no searching. Just results.

It sounds crazy, but I believe it's possible. The future might focus less on designing interfaces and more on structuring data for AI to process.

## Post 4: How I Became a Tech Lead

I once asked my manager why I was chosen to become a Tech Lead over others.

His answer boiled down to this:
- Focus on business & team impact
- Willing to do what others avoid
- Show ownership of the product
- Eager to learn and take action
- Help others without judgment
- Mentor junior developers

Becoming a Tech Lead requires more than just technical skills.

## Post 5: Organizing Dotfiles with GNU Stow

Setting up a new computer used to take me a whole day.

Then I discovered GNU Stow. Now, all my dotfiles live in one directory, tracked with Git.

When I get a new computer? Clone the repo, run `stow */`, and I'm done.

Simple, reproducible, and saves hours of manual configuration.

## Post 6: Browser Support Decisions

Before having clear minimum browser data, my team couldn't confidently use CSS Grid. We simply didn't know if it was safe.

Deciding minimum browser versions is crucial. It helps you:
- Use new web features confidently
- Avoid transpiling useless code
- Remove unnecessary polyfills
- Give clear direction to QA teams

The data-driven approach changed how we ship features.

## Post 7: Analyze Your Browser Visitors

How do you decide which browsers to support?

Start by analyzing your actual visitors with Google Analytics 4. The Exploration menu lets you track browser versions, not just browser names.

Combine this with global usage data from Browserslist, and you'll make informed decisions about browser support.

Analyze quarterly. Your users' browsers evolve faster than you think.

---

## Post 8: Use Browserslist for Browser Support

Browserslist combines data from Caniuse and StatCounter to help you make browser support decisions.

My favorite query? `defaults` — a shortcut for `> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead`

But you can customize it. For Indonesia-specific audiences: `>= 0.1% in ID, last 2 versions, not dead`

There's no one-size-fits-all. Start with defaults, then refine based on your real user data.

## Post 9: Building My Newsletter

I want my life to have meaning and give value to others.

That's why I started "Speak in Engineering" on Substack — a newsletter where I share:
- Engineering practice tips
- Career strategies
- Leadership insights
- Productivity advice

All readable in 5 minutes or less. The goal? Maximum impact, minimum words.

## Post 10: Understanding Legacy Code

How often do you find code that only the author and God understand?

Git Blame helps. But only if your commit messages are meaningful.

My team follows this format: "ISSUE-XXX Descriptive Commit Message"

Why? The issue code leads to:
1. WHAT problem was being solved
2. HOW it was solved (in the PR description)

Good commit messages = better decision-making when facing legacy code.

## Post 11: Spaces vs Tabs

I believe spaces are better than tabs. Why?

Consistency across editors.

I tested the same code with tabs across VSCode, Sublime Text, Atom, and GitLab. Each rendered the indentation differently.

With spaces? Perfect consistency everywhere.

If you care about precision and team collaboration, choose spaces.

## Post 12: Why I Love Being a Software Engineer

I got rejected from mechanical school because I'm colorblind.

Best rejection of my life.

I ended up in computer science, and now I realize God knew what was best for me.

Software engineering lets me:
- Accelerate life impact through technology
- Learn continuously
- Work remotely with my family
- Build solutions that generate real revenue
- Earn enough to support my family

Alhamdulilah for this amazing journey.

## Post 13: Capture Your Ideas

Brilliant ideas don't come when we're thinking hard.

They come when our brain is relaxed — exercising, washing dishes, eating ice cream.

Research shows that exercise increases blood flow to the brain, improving mood, concentration, and memory.

The key? Always capture ideas when they emerge. I use Notion to record even the most insignificant thoughts.

Ideas you consider useless now could be valuable in the future.

## Post 14: Avoid Bus Factors in Your Team

A "Bus Factor" is someone who, if hit by a bus (or leaving the team), would cripple progress.

It's not their fault—they're usually geniuses. But relying on one person creates risk.

How to avoid it:
1. Pairing sessions
2. Code reviews
3. Job rotation
4. Documentation

By eliminating Bus Factors, you make the entire team grow and learn new things.

## Post 15: My Vim Learning Journey

When I first tried Vim, it felt terrible. Just to write one word, I had to:
- Open Terminal
- Type `vim filename.js`
- Press `i` to insert text
- Press Esc, then `:wq` to save

I thought: "I need a text editor to support my productivity, not the other way around."

Years later, I gave Vim a second chance. Now I'm in love with its keyboard-centric workflow.

It's not for everyone, but it works for me.

## Post 16: Setting Up MacOS for Development

I once needed a whole day to configure a fresh MacBook.

Now I've documented everything in a living document. It includes:
- Homebrew for package management
- Zsh with Oh My Zsh plugins
- NVM for Node.js version management
- Delta for Git syntax highlighting
- System settings for productivity

This saved me hours on every new setup.

## Post 17: The Reality of Vibe Coding

I used Cursor to generate a complete landing page in seconds. It just worked.

That's when I felt what people meant by "Vibe Coding."

But when I brought this to a real team project? Messy code. Code I couldn't understand later.

Vibe Coding is great for exploration. But production code needs discipline, best practices, and code reviews.

## Post 18: Online Games That Build Teams

The best way to strengthen team dynamics? Step away from the keyboard and just... play.

My team's favorites:
- Gartic.io for quick ice breakers
- Garticphone for creative chaos
- Codenames for strategic thinking
- Geoguessr for geography nerds

Teams who play together communicate better at work.

## Post 19: AI Might Replace Junior Roles

Looking at AI-generated code, I can't shake this thought:

AI might replace junior roles, leaving only senior engineers to evaluate and refine AI-generated code.

Seniors would focus on architecture, best practices, and decision-making rather than hands-on coding.

This could make it harder for beginners to enter the field. They'd need experience reviewing solutions rather than learning by building from scratch.

## Post 20: Focus on Business Impact

Most engineers think they're hired to write code and get paid.

While partially true, remember: they hired you to help generate revenue.

This mindset helps you provide the right ideas and feedback, focusing on business and team impact.

It's what separates good engineers from great leaders.

## Post 23: Dotfiles Are Your Development DNA

Dotfiles often contain scattered configurations across various locations:
- `.zshrc` in the home directory
- Nvim configs in `~/.config/nvim/`
- SSH files in `~/.ssh/`

GNU Stow lets you manage all of them in a single directory, tracked with Git.

It's like having your development DNA backed up and ready to clone anywhere.

## Post 24: Why Set Minimum Browser Versions

Before we had clear browser data, we never knew if it was safe to use CSS Grid.

Now we analyze visitor browsers quarterly. This helps us:
- Confidently use new web features
- Avoid transpiling to ES5 unnecessarily
- Remove bloated polyfills
- Give QA teams clear testing directions
- Alert users with unsupported browsers

Data-driven decisions beat assumptions every time.

## Post 25: Learn and Take Action

Learning new things is a must-have habit for engineers. Technology evolves faster than we think.

But learning doesn't mean reading thick books or watching hours of tutorials.

You can learn from Substack notes, LinkedIn posts, and articles on the Internet.

What's important is how you turn learning into real actions that impact the team.

## Post 26: Help Others Without Judgment

When someone asks for help, don't blame them for their lack of knowledge.

They come to you because they trust you have the competence to help.

By helping others, you also learn to solve new problems you've never faced before.

It's a win-win.

## Post 28: Stay as the Curator

AI can generate hundreds of lines in seconds.

But you are responsible for the quality.

Always review: Is this code efficient? Secure? Understandable to others?

Don't commit and ship code you don't understand. Be the curator of what AI produces.

## Post 29: Vim Taught Me Productivity

Vim can fasten your typing experience—but only if you know the shortcuts.

Pros:
- Minimizes mouse usage
- Fully customizable to your preference

Cons:
- High learning curve
- Can become a productivity blocker if not used properly

My advice? Don't learn Vim during work hours or on deadlines. You'll regret it.

Software engineers work in front of screens most of the time.

This gives us the privilege to work from anywhere.

For me, working from home means:
- More time with my wife and family
- No commute stress
- Better work-life balance
- Flexibility to manage my schedule

Remote work isn't just a perk. It's a game-changer for quality of life.

## Post 34: The Science Behind Great Ideas

Research shows that when we exercise, blood pressure and blood flow increase throughout the body, including the brain.

More blood = more energy and oxygen = better brain function.

Neuroscientist Wendy Suzuki says exercise can improve mood, concentration, and memory.

Want better ideas? Stop thinking hard. Start moving.

## Post 35: Austin Kleon's Boredom Theory

Austin Kleon (author of "Steal Like an Artist") has a different take on creativity.

He says good ideas come when we're bored.

Need an idea? Try:
- Washing dishes
- Ironing clothes
- Taking a walk
- Staring at a wall

Brilliant ideas don't come when we're thinking hard. They come when our brain is relaxed.

## Post 36: Always Capture Your Ideas

I had a brilliant idea once while stuck at work.

Instead of focusing on the problem, I went to get ice cream. The solution appeared out of nowhere.

Now I always carry a tool to record ideas—I use Notion to capture everything, even "useless" ideas.

Why? Ideas you dismiss today might be valuable tomorrow. Never underestimate what pops into your head.

## Post 37: Pairing Sessions Eliminate Bus Factors

Want to prevent knowledge silos in your team?

Start pairing.

When tasks become complex, hold meetings to work on them together.

Benefits:
- Knowledge sharing happens naturally
- Multiple people understand the solution
- Team bonding improves
- No single point of failure

Pairing isn't just about code—it's about building resilient teams.

## Post 38: Code Review as Knowledge Transfer

Code review culture is one of the most effective ways to prevent Bus Factors.

Why? It requires reviewers to understand code written by others.

Want it even better? Do code reviews via meetings with conversations, not just async comments.

When everyone reviews everyone's code, knowledge spreads naturally across the team.

## Post 39: Job Rotation Builds T-Shaped Engineers

At my workplace, I split job responsibilities and rotate them monthly.

This forces team members to:
- Get out of their comfort zone
- Learn new things
- Back up each other
- Avoid boring routines

The result? Everyone has the same knowledge and can cover for each other.

Job rotation isn't just organizational—it's personal growth.

## Post 40: Documentation Scales Knowledge

Make documentation part of daily work, not an afterthought.

With proper documentation, anyone can do what's usually done by one person.

Documentation isn't bureaucracy. It's insurance against knowledge loss.

When that "genius" leaves the team, your documentation keeps the team running.

## Post 41: VSCodeVim: The Gateway to Vim

I didn't jump straight to Vim in the terminal.

I started with the VSCodeVim plugin for 6 months.

This plugin is perfect for someone who:
- Uses VSCode daily
- Wants the Vim experience
- Isn't ready for full terminal Vim

It's the best of both worlds—VSCode's features with Vim's efficiency.

## Post 42: zsh-vi-mode for Terminal Productivity

Here's a productivity hack: install zsh-vi-mode on your Terminal.

It gives you Vim experience when typing commands.

Got a really long command? Navigate it using Vim shortcuts.

It's a small change that makes terminal work significantly faster.

## Post 43: NvChad Distribution

NvChad is one of the most popular Vim distributions.

"Distribution" means Vim with full package—several plugins pre-installed, giving you features similar to VSCode.

I chose NvChad because it had the most GitHub stars when I started.

Other popular options: LunarVim, AstroVim.

For beginners, distributions are better than configuring Vim from scratch.

## Post 44: Vim's Learning Curve is Real

Vim isn't for everyone. It has a high learning curve.

You need dedicated time to learn it properly. If you're not used to it, it can block your work.

My advice: Only learn Vim during spare time or when there's no deadline.

Learning Vim during a deadline is setting yourself up for frustration.

## Post 45: Homebrew: The Mac Package Manager

Homebrew is the first thing I install on any Mac.

It's a package manager that lets you install applications via command line.

One command to install multiple apps:
```
brew install --cask docker chrome iterm2 slack vscode
```

No more downloading .dmg files manually. Homebrew automates everything.

## Post 46: Zsh Plugins That Boost Productivity

I use several Zsh plugins daily:

Built-in:
- git (shortcuts)
- autojump (quick directory navigation)
- copydir (copy current path)

External:
- zsh-autosuggestions (autocomplete from history)
- zsh-vim-mode (Vim-like shell)

These small tools save me hours every week.

## Post 47: Git Delta for Better Diffs

Tired of plain Git diffs?

Install Delta for syntax highlighting in Git.

It makes `git diff` and `git show` so much more readable and comfortable.

Installation:
```
brew install git-delta
```

Then configure your `.gitconfig`. Small change, huge impact.

## Post 48: NVM for Node Version Management

I install Node.js via NVM (Node Version Manager), not directly.

Why? I often need to switch between Node versions for different projects.

With NVM:
- Install any version: `nvm install 18.0.0`
- Switch versions: `nvm use 18.0.0`
- Set default: `nvm alias default 18.0.0`

One tool, infinite flexibility.

## Post 49: Git Blame for Legacy Code Context

Found confusing code? Use Git Blame.

Git Blame shows you:
- Who wrote that line
- When it was written
- The commit message

But here's the key: Git Blame only helps if commit messages are meaningful.

Use format: "ISSUE-XXX Descriptive Message"

The issue code leads you to the full context: what problem was solved and how.

## Post 50: Commit Messages Should Include Issue Codes

My team always includes issue codes in commits:

"JIRA-123 Fix authentication timeout"

Why? Anyone can track the issue and get:
1. Issue details (WHAT needs to be solved)
2. PR description (HOW it was solved)
3. PRD links, design files, recordings

One commit message = gateway to full context.

Read more about this topic at https://trihargianto.com/blog/methods-to-understand-and-recall-legacy-code

---

## Post 51: PR Descriptions Matter

A well-written Pull Request description tells HOW a problem was solved.

It should include:
- Approach taken
- Trade-offs considered
- Testing performed
- Screenshots/recordings

Combined with issue details (WHAT), PR descriptions give complete context for future developers.

Don't underestimate PR descriptions—they're documentation.

## Post 52: Symlinks: The Magic Behind GNU Stow

When you run `stow zsh`, GNU Stow creates symbolic links (symlinks).

Symlinks make files appear in one location while actually living in another.

It's like a Windows shortcut but for Unix systems.

Your dotfiles stay organized in `~/.dotfiles`, but appear in `~` where apps expect them.

One directory. Multiple locations. Pure magic.

## Post 53: The Cost of Unnecessary Transpilation

Transpiling code to ES5 has been common since 2015.

But it's 2024. Do we still need to support ES5?

Without browser data, we don't know.

Unnecessary transpilation:
- Bloats JavaScript file size
- Slows down build times
- Impacts performance

Know your audience. Transpile only what you need.

## Post 54: Polyfills Without Direction

Polyfills provide modern functionality on older browsers.

But adding polyfills based on assumptions:
- Bloats your JavaScript
- Hurts performance
- Wastes user bandwidth

Only add polyfills you actually need based on real browser data.

## Post 55: Unsupported Browser Alerts Save Users

Putting an unsupported browser alert might seem harsh.

But it's better than letting users experience broken features without knowing why.

If you ship modern syntax and their browser breaks, the alert makes them aware to update.

It's not cool. But it's honest and helpful.
