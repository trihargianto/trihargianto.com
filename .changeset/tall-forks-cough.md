Migrate the underlying from [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to [Astro](https://astro.build/).

GatsbyJS has been abandoned and therefore can be considered dead. Fortunately, migrating the site to Astro is quite easy, most of the steps are just coming from [Astro official documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/from-gatsby/). Thanks to Astro team 👏

Some of the features are intended to be removed to fasten the development process. Those features might be revived in the future.

**Removed features**

- Reading time on blog detail page
- i18n support
- LinkedIn and Github links on footer
- Sentry error monitoring
