# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is Tri Hargianto's personal website (trihargianto.com), a digital garden featuring blog posts, projects, cheatsheets, and professional information. The site is built with Astro 5, React, and Tailwind CSS 4, deployed on Netlify.

## Development Commands

**Package manager:** pnpm (required version: 9.1.1+)

- **Dev server:** `pnpm dev`
- **Build:** `pnpm build` (builds Astro site and copies `_redirects` to dist)
- **Preview:** `pnpm preview`

**Note:** The build process includes a custom step to copy `_redirects` to the dist folder for Netlify redirects.

## Content Architecture

### Content Collections

The site uses Astro's Content Collections with glob loaders defined in `src/content.config.ts`:

- **blog** - Blog posts (Markdown/MDX) located in `src/content/blog/`

  - Schema includes: title, slug, description, pubDate, updatedDate, tags, featured image
  - Posts can be in multiple languages (though i18n was removed from current version)

- **cheatsheets** - Cheatsheet documents in `src/content/cheatsheets/`

  - Schema includes: title, slug, description, category, featured image

- **project** - Project showcases in `src/content/project/`

  - Schema includes: title, description, category, demoLink, githubLink

- **singlePage** - Single page content in `src/content/single-page/`
  - Schema includes: title, description

### Dynamic OG Images

The site generates dynamic Open Graph images for blog posts using `astro-og-canvas`. Implementation is in `src/pages/open-graph/[...route].ts`. When adding new content types that need OG images, reference this pattern.

## Page Routing

Key pages in `src/pages/`:

- `/` - Homepage
- `/blog` - Blog listing
- `/blog/[...slug]` - Individual blog posts
- `/blog/topic/[topic]` - Blog posts filtered by topic
- `/cheatsheets` - Cheatsheet listing
- `/cheatsheets/[...slug]` - Individual cheatsheet posts
- `/about`, `/speaking`, `/publications`, `/pet-projects`, `/media-kit`, `/guest-book` - Various static pages

## Layouts

The site uses shared layouts in `src/layouts/`:

- `BaseLayout.astro` - Main layout wrapper
- `BlogPostLayout.astro` - Blog post template
- `BlogListLayout.astro` - Blog listing template
- `CheatsheetPostLayout.astro` - Cheatsheet post template
- `CheatsheetListLayout.astro` - Cheatsheet listing template

## Configuration

- **Site URL:** Defined in `astro.config.mjs` as `https://trihargianto.com`
- **Site constants:** Located in `src/constants/config.ts` (site title, description, social links, etc.)
- **Navigation:** Menu items in `src/constants/navbar-menu.ts`
- **Redirects:** Netlify redirects configured in `_redirects` file (handles old i18n routes, external links)

## Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS 4 via Vite plugin
- Typography plugin enabled for blog content styling
- Supports dark mode (see `DarkModeSwitcher.astro`)
- Custom styles in `src/styles/`

## Code Highlighting

Uses `astro-expressive-code` with themes:

- Dark: `catppuccin-frappe`
- Light: `one-light`

## Monitoring & Performance

- **Error monitoring:** Sentry (conditionally enabled via env vars: SENTRY_DSN, SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN)
- **Performance monitoring:** Unlighthouse at https://inspect.trihargianto.com
- **Deployment:** Netlify adapter configured

## React Components

Interactive components use React 19 with TypeScript:

- `TableOfContents.tsx` - Blog post table of contents
- `TocDrawerButton.tsx` - Mobile drawer for TOC
- Custom hooks in `src/hooks/` (e.g., `useScrollToTop.ts`)

## Code Formatting

Prettier configuration in `prettier.config.mjs`:

- 2 spaces, semicolons, double quotes
- Arrow parens always
- Trailing commas all
- Print width 80
- Astro plugin enabled

## TypeScript

- Uses strict Astro TypeScript config
- JSX runtime: React
- Strict null checks enabled

## Writing Guidelines

When creating or editing blog posts and content, maintain the author's established writing style (Upper-Intermediate to Advanced English).

### Voice & Tone

**Maintain conversational-professional balance:**

- Use friendly, approachable language while discussing technical topics
- Include personal anecdotes and real experiences to illustrate concepts
- Humble teaching approach - acknowledge limitations and different viewpoints
- Direct address to readers: "you," rhetorical questions, engaging hooks
- Avoid arrogance; focus on sharing knowledge, not showing off

**Examples of the author's voice:**

- "Let's be honestâ€”remote team building can feel forced"
- "Back then, in the hometown where I lived..."
- "I hope my writing here is useful. Thank you for reading ðŸ‘‹"

### Structure Standards

**Every blog post should follow this pattern:**

1. **Introduction:**

   - Engaging hook (question, scenario, or personal story)
   - Context setting
   - Clear statement of what the post covers

2. **Body:**

   - Clear organization with `##` and `###` headings
   - Logical flow: Problem â†’ Context â†’ Solution â†’ Implementation
   - Use numbered lists for steps, bulleted lists for options/features
   - Include practical examples, code snippets, screenshots where relevant
   - Break complex topics into digestible sections

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize key takeaways
   - Provide actionable next steps
   - Consistent closing: "Thank you for reading ðŸ‘‹" or similar

### Content Quality Standards

**Every post must include:**

1. **Actionable takeaways** - Readers should leave with something they can implement
2. **Technical accuracy** - Verify technical details and terminology
3. **Practical examples** - Real-world scenarios, not just theory
4. **External resources** - Cite research, link to tools/documentation appropriately
5. **Visual aids** - Screenshots, code blocks, diagrams where helpful

**Balance technical depth with accessibility:**

- Explain jargon on first use or link to definitions
- Assume intelligent readers who may not know specific tools
- Use analogies and metaphors to clarify complex concepts

### Formatting Conventions

Maintain consistency:

- **Bold** - For emphasis, key concepts, important terms

  - Example: "**Bus Factor**", "**One thing to note**"

- _Italics_ - For titles of books, movies, publications

  - Example: _Steal Like an Artist_, _Her_ (2013)

- `Backticks` - For code, technical terms, commands, file names

  - Example: `defaults`, `git status`, `symlinks`

- **Emojis** - Use sparingly and purposefully
  - Appropriate: Section headers (ðŸŽ¨, ðŸ§ , ðŸ’¡), closings (ðŸ‘‹)
  - Avoid: Excessive emoji that distracts from content

### Pre-Publishing Checklist

Before finalizing any blog post:

1. âœ“ Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
2. âœ“ Run through grammar checker (Grammarly/LanguageTool)
3. âœ“ Verify all article usage (a/an/the)
4. âœ“ Check that sentences aren't too long
5. âœ“ Ensure transitions between sections are smooth
6. âœ“ Confirm all code examples are tested and accurate
7. âœ“ Review that personal anecdotes enhance (not distract from) technical content
8. âœ“ Verify closing includes "Thank you for reading ðŸ‘‹" or similar

### Writing Philosophy

The author's strengths lie in:

- **Authentic storytelling** that hooks readers emotionally
- **Technical clarity** that makes complex topics accessible
- **Practical applicability** that provides immediate value
- **Balanced perspective** that acknowledges different viewpoints
- **Progressive improvement** over time
