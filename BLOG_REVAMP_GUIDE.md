## Usage Guide

### Marking a Post as Featured

```yaml
---
title: My Featured Post
featuredPost: true  # This will show it in the hero section
---
```

### Adding a Featured Image

```yaml
---
featured: ./cover.jpg
featuredSource: "John Doe"
featuredSourceUrl: "https://unsplash.com/@johndoe"
---
```

### Adding Categories and Tags

```yaml
---
category: "Frontend Engineering"  # Must match schema enum
tags: ["react", "performance", "web-vitals"]
---
```

### Best Practices

1. **Featured Images:**
   - Use high-quality images (1200px+ width)
   - Optimize before adding to reduce file size
   - Always credit the source

2. **Titles:**
   - Keep concise (60 characters or less)
   - Make descriptive and engaging
   - Avoid clickbait

3. **Descriptions:**
   - 1-2 sentences (120-160 characters)
   - Summarize the key takeaway
   - Include keywords for SEO

4. **Tags:**
   - Use 3-5 relevant tags
   - Be consistent with tag naming
   - Use lowercase for uniformity

5. **Reading Time:**
   - Automatically calculated
   - Include code blocks for accuracy
   - Longer articles (10+ min) may benefit from a TL;DR

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2 & 3)

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

**Error: `Cannot apply unknown utility class`**
- Tailwind v4 doesn't support some utilities in `@apply`
- Use plain CSS or inline styles instead
- Example: Use `box-shadow` instead of `@apply shadow-md`

**Error: `post.render is not a function`**
- Use `post.body` directly instead of `await post.render()`
- Fixed in current implementation

### Common Issues

**Featured post not showing:**
- Check that `featuredPost: true` is in frontmatter
- Verify the post is published (not a draft)
- Check console for errors

**Search not working:**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify posts have title and description

**Layout toggle not saving:**
- Check localStorage permissions
- Ensure cookies are not blocked
- Try in incognito mode

## Migration Notes

### From Old Blog Layout

The old layout is preserved as `BlogListLayout.astro.backup`. Key differences:

**Old Layout:**
- Simple list grouped by year
- Single tag filter
- No search functionality
- Basic typography

**New Layout:**
- Hero section with featured post
- Masonry grid with cards
- Advanced search and filters
- Layout toggle (Grid/List)
- Enhanced typography
- Reading time estimates

### Breaking Changes
None! The new layout is backward compatible with existing blog posts.

### Optional Migrations
1. Add `featuredPost: true` to highlight important posts
2. Add featured images to posts without them
3. Add or update categories to match schema
4. Review and standardize tags across posts
