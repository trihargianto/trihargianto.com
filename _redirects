# NETLIFY REDIRECT CONFIGURATIONS
# Ref: https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/

# Handle redirection for old pages from old site (GatsbyJS ver).
# The old site support i18n, but the new site doesn't.
# I decided to remove i18n support on the new site because it's too much work to maintain.
# Thus, we need to redirect old i18n pages to the new ones.
