<p></p>

I want my life to have meaning and give value to others. Extracting what’s inside my brain into articles and delivering them to my subscribers, hoping that they’ll be useful and have a real impact based on my personal experience is part of my mission.

Currently, this site doesn’t support a newsletter system, and I want an efficient way to reach my audience. After searching a solution on the internet, I found a platform called [Substack](https://substack.com/), which is surprisingly quite popular.

Substack is a platform for publishing newsletters directly to the audience. I can easily publish content, manage subscribers, and track engagement with it.

The newsletter itself is called "[Speak in Engineering](https://speakengineering.substack.com)".

Here's what you can expect from it:

- 💻 **Engineering Practice Tips** -- Quick, actionable advice to improve your engineering skills and efficiency.

- 🏆 **Engineering Career Tips** -- Strategies to advance your engineering career and achieve your professional goals.

- 🤝 **Leadership** -- Essential tips on leading teams and managing projects effectively in engineering.

- 📈 **Self-Improvements and Productivity** -- Practical advice for personal growth, productivity, and well-being.

- ⚡️ **Readable in 5 minutes or less** -- The goal of my writing is to convey the most impactful information using the least words possible.

Anyway, building a newsletter on Substack won’t make me stop to create articles on this site. This site will still be contained with my personal thoughts.

If you would like to know what’s inside my brain based on my personal experience, then don’t hesitate to subscribe the Speak in Engineering by clicking the link below
